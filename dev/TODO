Check were eplison is applied
Check noise parameters are correct
Check sky <--> focal plane coordinates
copy survey to data_dir AND plot, with coverage??
MeasuredCatalog.flux - are we doing the noise correctly here?

Keep sky coordinates in the measured catalog to make plotting easier

Bugs:
-----

 + MeasuredCatalog.true_invvar - multiplied by flat-field one time too many??
 + Generate epsilon now per measurement and not per source
